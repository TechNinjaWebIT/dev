I honestly believe I would not be where I am today if it wasn&#8217;t for Mom and Pop&#8217;s. I can&#8217;t thank you guys enough for everything you have done for me.&#8221;</q><div class="clearfix"><span class="company-name"><strong>Amy G.</strong>,<span> Former Resident</span></span></div></blockquote></div>
<div class="review male"><blockquote><q>&#8220;I can&#8217;t honestly say where I would be today without Mom and Pop&#8217;s place. I am thankful for the structured environment they provide that has enabled me to transition back into society. After being a part of the 12 step community for 9 months, I can say I have never heard of another halfway where the owners and management were so involved with the community. Eddie and his partners, Mike and Noelia, have always been more than supportive when it came to my personal recovery. I feel like I have a family here and I think that a sense of belonging is important to anyone who is undertaking the journey of recovery.&#8221;</q><div class="clearfix"><span class="company-name"><strong>Parker A.</strong>,<span> Former Resident</span></span></div></blockquote></div>
<div class="review male"><blockquote><q>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t stay sober if my life depended on it. Mom and Pops&#8217;s worked for me. Eddie, Mike, and family had a great influence on my recovery. Everything about Mom and Pop&#8217;s is positive and about recovery &#8211; from the fun events to living and being treated like a special person. If you are serious about recovery, this is the place.&#8221;</q><div class="clearfix"><span class="company-name"><strong>Joe M.</strong>,<span> Former Resident</span></span></div></blockquote></div>
<div class="review female"><blockquote><q>&#8220;When I first came to Mom and Pop&#8217;s House I was lonely, afraid and had very poor relationships with other people. After being open and willing to follow suggestions, and accept the guidance of the staff, I have formed healthy relationships with the community, grown spiritually and am now ready to take the next step in my journey with having my own place. I am forever grateful for Mom and Pop&#8217;s and the wonderful community. Their support and guidance is beyond words.&#8221;</q><div class="clearfix"><span class="company-name"><strong>Jennifer W.</strong>,<span> Former Resident</span></span></div></blockquote></div>
